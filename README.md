# Web Development
This is where I store most of my website projects that I have accumulated. Most of them involved purely HTML & CSS, (HTML5 & CSS3), use of semantic tags, min/max-width and height to ensure responsive webpages are created.
Will be looking into JavaScript and implementing BootStrap as I go.
